/**
 * Eodan, the tanner in the Lizardman Caves. Op1 = Talk-to, op3 = Tan-hides.
 *
 * His two lore options loop back to the menu ("(Shows other options)" in the transcript), so the
 * whole dialogue is one loop that only exits when the player tans or leaves.
 *
 * Pricing is the interesting part: he discounts by Kourend & Kebos diary tier, highest completed
 * tier winning - see [EodanTier]. There is no diary system in the server yet, so the tier is read
 * straight off the four completion varbits; if they aren't in the cache every player is simply
 * treated as having completed none, which is the correct default anyway.
